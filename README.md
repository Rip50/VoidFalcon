# VoidFalcon

VoidFalcon is a retro-styled space shooter with a unique twist: combining fast-paced gameplay with typing challenges.

## Key Features
- **Unique Gameplay**: Destroy enemies by typing words displayed above them.
- **Retro Style**: Minimalistic graphics inspired by vector-based design.
- **Seamless Transitions**: Levels change through smooth cloud animations.
- **Customizable Dictionaries**: JSON-based dictionaries for flexible difficulty scaling.
- **Bonus System**: Dynamic bonus drops that impact gameplay mechanics.
- **Progress Saving**: Player name and score are saved locally.

## Project Structure
- **Scenes**: Game scenes (`Main`, `Game`, `Player`, `Enemy`, etc.).
- **Scripts**: Core game logic (`GameManager.gd`, `PlayerControl.gd`, etc.).
- **Assets**: Game resources (sprites, sounds, fonts).
- **UI**: User interface components (HUD, menus).
- **Components**: Reusable elements (e.g., `HealthBar`, `WordInput`).

## Objective
VoidFalcon is being developed as an educational and entertaining project, merging elements of a space shooter with a typing trainer.
